I just needed to do this same thing and came up with the following one-liner:

Warning: This will delete all of your buckets/files that you have access to. Make sure you really need to do this before running this script!

aws s3 ls | cut -d" " -f 3 | xargs -I{} aws s3 rb s3://{} --force

If you only want to remove empty buckets remove the --force flag:
aws s3 ls | cut -d" " -f 3 | xargs -I{} aws s3 rb s3://{}
